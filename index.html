    <p>We are using GameMaker to make a 2d platform game.</p>

    <h2>About GameMaker</h2>

    <p>GameMaker is a popular game-making tool for beginners. It's relatively easy to learn, but can take you all the way to making commercially successful games.</p>

    <p>
      <button class="btn btn-primary" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#collapseExampleGames" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseExample">
        Can I see some example games made in GameMaker?
      </button>

     <h2>GameMaker at AUT</h2>

     <p>This term, we are using GameMaker 1.4.</p>

    <p>
      <button class="btn btn-primary" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#collapseGMatHome" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseExample">
        How can I get GameMaker 1.4 at home?
      </button>
    </p>
    <div class="collapse" id="collapseGMatHome">
      <div class="card card-block">
        <p>We are using GameMaker 1.4, which only works on Windows computers.</p>

        <p>Due to recent changes, getting GameMaker for free is a little bit tricky. Follow these steps.</p>

       <p>(The trick is to install GameMaker 1.3, which comes with a free licence, then upgrade to GameMaker 1.4, which no longer comes with a free licence as of 8th March 2017.)</p>

       <ul>
       <li>Go to <a target="_blank" href="http://ccm.net/download/download-23641-gamemaker-studio-standard">http://ccm.net/download/download-23641-gamemaker-studio-standard</a></li>
       <li>Click the green download button (It says Download Freeware 172.7 MB)</li>
       <li>Wait for the download to finish.</li>
       <li>Run the installer and then start GameMaker Studio 1.3</li>
       <li>Two windows will pop up. One says “A new version of GameMaker-Studio is available”.</li>
       <li>Choose Remind Me Later - we do not want to update to the new version yet!</li>
       <li>The other window has 3 options. Choose the middle option by entering your email address and clicking ‘register’. Follow the process until you are emailed a licence key. Enter this in the box and continue. Then close GameMaker and reopen it.</li>
       <li>GameMaker will ask you t.o update again. Now you have a licence, so it is OK to update to the latest version.</li>
     </ul>
   </div>
 </div>

 <p>
   <button class="btn btn-primary" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#collapseTipsAtAUT" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseExample">
     GameMaker is really slow at AUT | GameMaker won't run my game at AUT
   </button>
 </p>
 <div class="collapse" id="collapseTipsAtAUT">
   <div class="card card-block">
        <h3>Speed up saving, running and backups</h3>
        <p>In GameMaker, go to File -> Preferences.</p>

        <p>Near the bottom, you will see paths for Temp directory, Asset Cache directory, Backup directory and Home directory. Change all of these to a folder on your computer's desktop.</p>
        <p>This will make GameMaker work a lot faster.</p>
        <h3>GameMaker won't open my game???</h3>
        <p>It doesn't like reading games straight from a USB drive.</p>
        <p>Copy your game folder onto the desktop, then open it from there. When you leave the room, remember to copy it back onto your USB drive.</p>

<h2>Workshop Activities</h2>

<h3>Creating Sprites, Objects and Rooms</h3>

<p>You need to be able to do this before you can do any of the other activities.</p>

<p>
   <button class="btn btn-primary" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#collapseSpritesObjectsRooms" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseExample">
     Tell me about Sprites, Objects and Rooms
   </button>
 </p>
 <div class="collapse" id="collapseSpritesObjectsRooms">
   <div class="card card-block">

    <p>Start a new project.</p>
    <h4>Create a sprite:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Right-click on the Sprites label on the left side of the screen and choose Create Sprite.</li>
      <li>This opens up the Sprite Properties</li>
      <li>Change the name to spr_player</li>
      <li>Click ‘Edit Sprite’ to open the Sprite Editor</li>
      <li>Click on the blank page icon to create a sprite</li>
      <li>You can accept the default size of 32 x 32 and click 'OK'</li>
      <li></li>
      <li>The Image Editor appears. Use the drawing tools to draw a quick picture, then close the Image Editor and Sprite Editor.</li>
      <li>In the <i>Sprite Properties</i> window, center the sprite by clicking ‘Center’ in the origin box</li>

    </ul>

    <h4>Create another sprite:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Follow the same process as above</li>
      <li>Name this sprite spr_wall</li>
      <li>Draw an image of a wall.</li>
      <li>Remember to center it.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Create an object</h4>
    
    Right click on ‘Objects’ in the main window and choose Create Object.
    Name the object obj_player
    Click on ‘<no sprite>’ and change it to spr_player
    Create another object named obj_wall and change its sprite to spr_wall
    Create a room by right-clicking on Rooms and choosing Create Room.
    In the Room Editor, you can place objects:
     Clicking on the ‘objects tab’
    clicking in the empty area below the tab and choose what object to place
    Click inside the room to place copies of that object
    Place one obj_player and many obj_walls in your room.
    Close the room editor
    Set up the obj_player events and actions:
    Select obj_player so the Object Editor appears again.
    Use the button below the Events section to add a Create event.
    On the right hand side, click on the ‘control’ tab - this will show the code blocks.
    Drag the blank white page icon into the Actions box. This is you saying ‘When this object is created, I want some code to be read.’
    A code editor will pop up - you can close it for now.
    Now create another Event: A step event. You will be asked to choose what kind of step, choose the normal step.
    Once again, drag the blank white page icon into the Actions box. This is you saying: ‘On every step of the game, I want some code to be read’.
    A code editor will pop up again - you can close it for now.
    You can bring the code editor back by clicking on the code action. Make sure you choose the right event first! There are two different code sections, one inside the ‘Create’ event and one inside the ‘Step’ event.

    The Create event happens once when an object is created. The Step event happens over and over again, usually 30 or 60 times each second.
